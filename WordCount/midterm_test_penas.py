Writers are encouraged to consult a thesaurus and change up that pesky offending word. But is this really true? Literature is full of repetition. Literary writers constantly use the literary device of repeated words. I think the only type of repetition which is bad is sloppy repetition. Repetition which is unintentional, which sounds awkward. If you repeat on purpose, repetition is gorgeous. I mean, think about music. Music is all about repetition and patterns. If you didnâ€™t have repetition in music, it would all just be noise."
